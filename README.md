E2TKFace

Accurate 3D face reconstruction from a single 2D image remains a challenging task in computer vision because existing neural networks lack rotation robustness. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called E2TKFace, which combines
a group equivariant convolutional neural network architecture with a window attention mechanism for 3D face alignment and reconstruction. E2TKFace uses a UV position map to represent the 3D face, allowing the prediction of over 50,000
points using a 256-size UV map. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of E2TKFace in handling challenging and complex facial poses.
